# Zakat Deduction Calculator in Core Java

This repository contains a **Console-Based Zakat Deduction Calculator** develope using **Core Java** concepts. The project is created as part of my **University 4th Semester Assignment** and serves as a practical hands-on learning experience in Java programming.

## Project Overview ðŸ“Š

The **Zakat Deduction Calculator** is a simple program designed to calculate Zakat based on the user's input of their wealth, in accordance with Islamic principles. The project demonstrates:
- **Basic arithmetic operations** in Java.
- Application of **conditional statements** to determine Zakat applicability.
- Console-based input/output operations using **Javaâ€™s Scanner class**.

Zakat is calculated at a rate of **2.5%** of an individual's total savings if the amount exceeds a certain threshold (Nisab).

## Features âœ¨

- **User Input**: Users can enter their total savings amount.
- **Zakat Calculation**: The program calculates Zakat at the rate of **2.5%** on the total savings.
- **Threshold Check**: Zakat is only deducted if the savings exceed the minimum Nisab value.
- **Console-based Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use console interaction.

## PRECAUTIONS
1. Zakat Deduction only on 7.5 tola gold, 52.5 tola silver or your savings equal or greater than the price of 52.5 tola silver (i.e. 131,250) or the sum of your savings, silver, gold is equal or greater than the price of 52.5 tola silver on duration minimum 1 year.
2. Zakat deduction ratio 2.5 percent or /40 on the above mention amounts. i.e. 131,250*2.5% or 131,250/40 = 3,281.25 PRs.
3. Gold price -> 1 tola = 203,437 PKR and Silver price -> 1 tola = 2,540 PKR

## NOTE
- These all specifications of amount (i.e. gold, silver and cash amounts) depend on that sceniario when this code generated.
- Kindly first check the amount (i.e. gold, silver and cash amounts) on the current situation and upgrsde the code then calculate your Zakat Deduction.
